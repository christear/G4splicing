# G4splicing

code for regenerating figures in the RNA G4 splicing study.


#### Enviroment and required libraries
- python 3.9  
- R 4.1.0
- R libraries: ggpubr, gplots, data.table
- G4Hunter (https://github.com/AnimaTardeb/G4Hunter)
- BEDTOOLS 2.30

#### Quick start
To regenerate the figures, downloading the pre-computed data, loading them into R, and running the script under the directory 'Rscript'.

The 'ana.g4.seq.py' is the in-house python script for analyzing nucleotide content and searching G4 motifs from the previous study.

The 'convert.g4hres2tab.py' is the in-house python script to convert the G4Hunter output to tables
